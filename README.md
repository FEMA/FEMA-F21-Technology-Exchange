# FEMA OCTO Virtual Technology Exchange - Fall 2021

Welcome to FEMA's Office of the Chief Technology Officer repository for the Fall 2021 Virtual Technology Exchange!

## Participant Feedback & Contributions

For the participants in the FEMA-F21 Technology Exchange that have files, white papers, suggestions, solution samples, demos, code, or other technological responses you wish to be considered, create a repository under your own GitHub account and **tag it with the "fema-f21" topic**. See the GitHub document [Classifying Your Repository with Topics](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/classifying-your-repository-with-topics). This will facilitate monitoring of the social conversation around the “fema-f21” GitHub topic tag following the event.


Enable the [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart) feature within your repository to promote conversations around solutions or posted material. Only general discussions should occur within this FEMA repository.

When considering non-code files for your repositories, we prefer open, text-based formats (PDF, PowerPoint, Word, Excel files may not be reviewed by FEMA). Image files such as PNG or JPG are also acceptable.

- Markdown
- LaTeX (although not natively supported, LaTeX within a Jupyter Notebook will be displayed)
- draw.io
- PlantUML (although not directly supported in GitHub, the PlantUML proxy can be used)
- GeoJson
- Jupyter notebooks
- BPMN diagrams

We encourage you to read this project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT).
